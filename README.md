# Polynomial Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression using Python and the scikit-learn library. Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable as an nth-degree polynomial. This allows capturing non-linear patterns in the data.

## Description

The project uses a dataset (`Position_Salaries.csv`) to predict salaries based on position levels. The key steps of the project are as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries:** Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Importing Dataset:** The dataset is loaded, and independent variables (`X`: Position Level) and the dependent variable (`y`: Salary) are extracted.

3. **Training Linear Regression Model:** A simple Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset to serve as a baseline.

4. **Training Polynomial Regression Model:** Polynomial features of degree 4 are created using scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures`, and a new Linear Regression model is trained on the transformed data.

5. **Visualizing Results:** The project visualizes the Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression results using Matplotlib.

6. **Predicting New Results:** The project demonstrates how to predict new results using both the Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/repoabhi-git/polynomial-regression.git
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python polynomial_regression.py
## Usage
Modify the script as needed or use it as a template for your own Polynomial Regression tasks. Ensure that you have a dataset in the same format as Position_Salaries.csv for training and testing.

## Results
The project visualizes both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression results, providing insights into the accuracy and fit of the polynomial model for the given dataset.
